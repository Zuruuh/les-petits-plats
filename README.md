## Usage

### Installation

To setup the project locally, you need to meet the following requirements:

- Git
- NodeJS (Version ^17, prefer installation using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- Yarn (Install with `npm i -g yarn`)

Once everything is installed, you can clone the project locally with the following command:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Zuruuh/les-petits-plats
cd les-petits-plats
```

Then, install all the npm dependencies with `yarn install`.

### Development

To run the project locally, use the npm script _dev_ with `yarn run dev`, and the project will be served locally at http://localhost:5173.
You will benefit from ViteJS Hot Module Replacement which will update all your code directly in your browser when you edit it.

### Production

To build the project for production, simply run `yarn run build` and you will get your prod-ready project in the _./dist_ folder.

## Tools

This project has multiple tools setup by default, let's take a look at all of them ðŸš€

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  - Allows to use a typing system during dev time before transpiling to javascript.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)

    Example features: Nesting, Functions, Mixins, Variables, Inheritance
- Linters, Formatters, Static-Code Analyzers
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
  - [Eslint](https://eslint.org)

    It utilizes Hot Module Replacement to update your code directly in your browser without loosing its state and extremely fast.
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org)
  - Tool used to apply modifications on css during build time, has a very large plugin ecosystem that can help a lot with common issues.
  * [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com)
    - Reduces drastically final css bundle size by making sure every css selector is actually used in final html files, and will get rid of unused ones.

    - Makes sure our css will support as much browsers as possible by adding custom vendor prefixes to css declarations that might behave differently depending on the browser interpreting it.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
  - Continuous Integration
    - Since this project utilizes a lot ot linters, formatters, static-code analyzers, etc... Making sure they are correctly used is vital!  
      All linters are run whenever someone pushes on a branch, and they need to all pass in order to be able to merge a pull request.
